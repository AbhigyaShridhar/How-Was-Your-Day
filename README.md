# How-Was-Your-Day
Submission for Hack Harvard 2021


This is a django project, and the app data is in the "applications" directory

The AssemblyAI code can be found in "applications/AssemblyAI.py"

The assemblyAI takes about 40% of the video length time to complete, and in order to get the complete "summarry", we need

our function to "sleep" for about 20-30 seconds. That's why we've used a dummy audio in our youtube video. But the actual 

audio file which we used to create the Chat Server displayed in the Youtube video can be seen in the "application/media/audio"

directory.
